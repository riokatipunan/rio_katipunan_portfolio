# Data Science Portfolio of Apolinario J. Katipunan
This is a repository of all my personal projects showcasing my skills in data analysis, data engineering and machine learning. I have also included in this repository the notebooks that I have used while learning through these topics. 

If you find them interesting, please feel free to contact me at riokatipunan@gmail.com.

Thanks!

The following are the contents of this repository

## Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting
This repository stores the the notebooks that I have used in studying time series forecasting using deep learning models and classical models as provided in the book "Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting" by Jason Brownlee.

The classical models studied in this repository are the holt-winters smoothing and SARIMAX. The machine learning and/or deep learning models that wer studied are the following

1. Multi-layer perceptrons
2. Convolutional Neural Networks
3. Long-Short Term Memory Neural Networks

This repository also explored univariate and multivariate time-series forecasting. 

## Application of Machine Learning in Stock Trading
This repository stores the notebooks that I have used in studying machine learning and applying these as a decision support system in stock trading. Currently, I have implemented it using fuzzy logic. I intend to explore other machine learning models such as neural networks, genetic algorithms, and reinforcement learning.
