# Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting

This repository stores the the notebooks that I have used in studying time series forecasting using deep learning models and classical models as provided in the book "Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting" by Jason Brownlee.

The classical models studied in this repository are the holt-winters smoothing and SARIMAX. The machine learning and/or deep learning models that wer studied are the following

1. Multi-layer perceptrons
2. Convolutional Neural Networks
3. Long-Short Term Memory Neural Networks

This repository also explored univariate and multivariate time-series forecasting.
