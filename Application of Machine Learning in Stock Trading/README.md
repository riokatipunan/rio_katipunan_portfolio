# Application of Machine Learning in Stock Trading

This project explores the use of various machine learning algorithms in stock trading

## [Application of Fuzzy Logic in Stock Trading](./Notebooks/Application%20of%20fuzzy%20logic%20to%20stock%20trading/)

This project explores the application of fuzzy logic (in particular, the Tsukamoto fuzzy inference model) in stock trading. This notebook uses multiple technical indicators and consolidates them through fuzzy logic and inferes either a buy, hold, or sell signal for a particular stock (through the Tsukamoto inference model).

## [Application of Fuzzy Logic and Genetic Algorithm in Stock Trading](./Notebooks/Application%20of%20fuzzy%20logic%20and%20genetic%20algorithms%20to%20stock%20trading/)

This project is a natural continuation of the project above. In this repository, the parameters of the fuzzy logic inference system are optimized using genetic algorithm.

## [Application of Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithm in Stock Trading](./Notebooks/Application%20of%20Genetic%20Algorithm%20and%20Neural%20Networks%20in%20Stock%20Trading/)

This notebook explores the application of Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithm in stock trading.
